The MarkLogic Koop Provider is an instance of an
[Esri Koop provider](https://koopjs.github.io/docs/basics/what-is-koop) that allows for geospatial data in
[MarkLogic](https://www.marklogic.com/) to be queried via the
[ArcGIS Feature Service API](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/feature-service.htm) and
the standard [GeoServices Query API](https://geoservices.github.io/query.html) . A diverse set of clients - including
enterprise applications like [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/resources) or open
source tools like [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) - can then access geospatial data in MarkLogic via these
standard APIs.
